# Students-Grades-Prediction
# Predict students grades either pass or fail
# Description
Education is vital in the society, many education authorities in the world working hard to improve this area. The educational frameworks need, at this particular time, unconventional ways to improve the quality to accomplish the best outcomes and decrease the failures. Predict the student’s performance in educational assessments is a critical problem to solve, with many factors which contributes to the outcomes achieved by a student. However, more accurate and effective prediction of students pass rates and identify the factors most firmly associated with high grades being achieved may allow us a better understanding to be acquired and best practice to be developed. Covid pandemic that has disturbed life all over the world in 2020, the educational frameworks have been impacted in numerous ways; different studies show that student’s performance has decreased from that point forward, which highlights the need to address this issue more significantly. This study will focus to build a model to classify and capable of predict either the student will pass or fail on the basis of numerous factors. Also, identify the most important features that are associated with a student’s pass or fail the assessment. 
# Data Acquisition
The student grade dataset consists of 395 observations and 32 attributes with different datatypes including categorical, numerical, nominal and Boolean. This dataset presents data on various factors that can affect the student performance. The aim of the study is build a model to classify and capable of predict either the student will pass or fail on the basis of numerous factors. Also, identify the most important features that are associated with a student’s pass or fail the assessment.
